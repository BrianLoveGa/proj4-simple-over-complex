__Simple > Complex__ .... a basic 'game' in __Python3__ and In __JavaScript__

******

My goal here is to provide a simple game coded in Python3 that users can copy and paste into their code editors or even the Python IDLE app and play if they are a little to a lot experienced.


Simple being 1 hero/heroine character you choose the name for ... 1 'bad-guy' ... and 3 questions (riddles, puzzles) to solve. You start with 10 health and 10 attack, the 'bad guy' has 50 health and 50 attack.


Upon answering/solving the questions correctly you will gain something like 20 health and 20 attack points. Making it essential to answer the 3 questions before you can win the fight. Maybe have a little lesson about using words before resulting to fighting in the real world in there somewhere.


Also will have instructions (typed out markdown style / embedded video/link to youtube) for creating a git hub account, installing python, installing a code editor (sublime or vs code) and using the new code editor to have a hello world file saved on git hub. and how to pay this 'game' now that you have some basics set up for coding.


Also, I would like to have that same game recreated in JavaScript and playable through the webpage - either via prompts, or the console log, and eventually a playable version in the browser using a button and input field where the text appears on the page.


The code for the JS versions would all be separate files so they can be compared and contrasted to the original python version.


All files will be available to be copied down - or can just clone the whole repo.


Users can then use this starter version to continue on and make a simple game in Python or Js.


Coming from a background of loving video games and dreaming of coding for years before I took the plunge a site like this had I found it in my youth might have started me down this road much sooner. It also should be helpful if anyone is well versed in one but not the other language (Python vs JS).


No plan for APIs currently, or any crud for this project - if you want to see crud functionality look back at my Cheer Ups or the dang Good Dessert Zone projects.


This is more for learning the basics and appealing to new potential coders.


If I get done with time to spare (hahaha) I'd add a more complicated game in python and it's equivalent in prompts/console log / on-screen in JavaScript.

languages: HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python (likely react or maybe handlebars for views)


Would use python3 for starter version of game (not playable in the webpage but able to be copied and run locally to play), would use HTML CSS JS for page(s) themselves, would use Javascript for the playable in-browser versions. 


kinda like this ...

index.html (for the webpage) and view1.html, view2.html, view3.html ........ and so on

main.css (for the webpage) maybe a view1.css and view2.css .... if needed...

page.js (for the webpage)

simple.py ( where user can copy paste and play locally)

simple_prompts.js ( to play the same game but through prompts in browser)

simple_consolelog.js (to play in console log in browser)

simple_browser.js (to play directly on-page in browser)
