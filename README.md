__Simple > Complex__ .... a basic 'game' in __Python3__ and In __JavaScript__

******
Drawing on Inspiration from 'The Zen of Python' by: Tim peters
```
Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

My goal here is to provide a simple game coded in Python3 that users can copy and paste into their code editors or even the Python IDLE app and play if they are a little to a lot experienced.

Simple being 1 hero/heroine character you choose the name for ... 1 'bad-guy' class ... and 3 questions (riddles, puzzles) to solve. You start with 10 health and 10 attack, the 'bad guy' has 50 health and 50 attack.

Upon answering/solving the questions correctly you will gain something like 15 health and 15 attack points. Making it essential to answer the 3 questions before you can win the fight. Maybe have a little lesson about using words before resulting to fighting in the real world in there somewhere.

Also will have instructions (typed out markdown style or embedded video/link to You Tube tutorial I make) for creating a GitHub account, installing Python, installing a code editor (Sublime or VS code) and using the new code editor to have a hello world file saved on GitHub. Include how to play this 'game' now that you have some basics set up for coding.

Also, I would like to have that same game recreated in JavaScript and playable through the webpage - either via prompts, or the console log, and eventually a playable version in the browser using a button and input field where the text appears on the page.

The code for the JS versions would all be separate files so they can be compared and contrasted to the original Python version.

All files will be available to be copied down - or can just clone the whole repo.

Users can then use this starter version to continue on and make a simple game in Python or Js.

Coming from a background of loving video games and dreaming of coding for years before I took the plunge a site like this, had I found it in my youth, might have started me down this code road much sooner. It also should be helpful if anyone is well versed in one but not the other language (Python vs JS).

No plan for APIs currently, or any crud for this project - if you want to see crud functionality look back at my Cheer Ups or the dang Good Dessert Zone projects.

This is more for learning the basics and appealing to new potential coders.

If I get done with time to spare (hahaha) I'd add a more complicated game in Python and it's equivalent in prompts/console log / on-screen in JavaScript.

languages: HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python (likely React or maybe Handlebars for views) no databases being used so no real back-end needed, no plans for leaderboard or really keeping score for this simple game. 

Would use Python3 for starter version of game (not playable in the webpage but able to be copied and run locally to play), would use HTML, CSS, & JS for pages themselves, would use JS for the playable in-browser versions. 

kinda like this ...

index.html (for the webpage) and view1.html (python code), view2.html (how to github & install python tutorials), view3.html (JS console log version), view4.html (prompts JS version) ........ and so on

main.css (for the webpage) maybe a view1.css and view2.css .... if needed... but not much planned for graphics 

page.js (for the webpage functionality if even necessary)

simple.py ( where user can copy paste and play locally)

simple_prompts.js ( to play the same game but through prompts in browser)

simple_consolelog.js (to play in console log in browser)

simple_browser.js (to play directly on-page in browser)
