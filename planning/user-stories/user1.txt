*from https://stormotion.io/blog/how-to-write-a-good-user-story-with-examples-templates/


*The User Story format (which is used by the Stormotion team as well) is quite plain 
*and short:

*As a [type of user], I want [an action] so that [a benefit/a value]


As a [ kid / teen looking into possibly coding ], 
I want [ a site with a simple game I can make and modify ]  
so that [ I can get into learning code ]


my main goal is a simple game in Python3 and in console log or prompts via JS
and instructions on how to get started coding and play these.
